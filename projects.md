1. **Flare Removal (Google Research Inspired)**  
Re-implemented and enhanced a deep learning model for lens flare removal using semi-synthetic flare-corrupted image pairs generated via empirical and wave-optics simulation. Improved generalization across real-world scenarios, achieving ~3â€¯dB PSNR gain over baselines.

2. **Vision Transformer (ViT)**  
Implemented the original Vision Transformer architecture for image classification based on patch embedding and transformer encoder blocks. Trained on standard datasets and explored fine-tuning techniques for better performance.

3. **Speech-Driven Personal Note Taker**  
Developed a voice-enabled system using OpenAI Whisper and spaCy NLP to transcribe speech and extract key information in real-time. Integrated optional TTS feedback and structured note formatting.
