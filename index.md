## About Me

Hello! :wave:

I'm Pushpesh, a B.tech Computer Science student at Shri Mata Vaisno Devi University.

My interests are in Computer Vision, LLM, Bash Scripting and 

Under the [Project](projects/) tab, you'll find some of my supplementary material for courses I lectured/TA'ed.

Under the [Misc](exp/) tab, you'll find Miscellaneous stuff I've done.

As of May 2022, I am working on Computer Vision with Pytorch at SMVDU, RP-126.
