## About Me

Hello! :wave:

I'm Ben, a PhD student at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, advised by Prof. Michael Elhadad.

My research interest is Natural Language Processing, and I am currently working on the Text-to-SQL task. In my MSc I worked on the Semantic Role Labeling task (the resulting paper is under [Publications](/publications/)).

Under the [Teaching](/teaching/) tab, you'll find some of my supplementary material for courses I lectured/TA'ed.

As of May 2022, I am working on [SPIKE](https://spike.apps.allenai.org/) at AI2 Israel.
